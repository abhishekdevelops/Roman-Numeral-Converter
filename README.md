- Converts numbers from 1 to 3999 to accurate Roman numerals
- Validates input and handles edge cases with clear messages
- Clean, responsive, and beginner-friendly UI

## 📘 Overview
This project helps you understand logic building and condition handling using pure JavaScript. It uses a greedy algorithm approach to map Roman numeral symbols to their values and subtract them step-by-step from the input number.

In this project, you'll learn how to:
- Work with arrays of objects
- Use `while` and `for` loops
- Handle DOM events and update output dynamically
- Create real-time validation with `if` conditions
